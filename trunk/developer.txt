--------------------

This document contains the programming conventions, documentation
conventions and other information useful for developers or individuals
who want to contribute code or bug reports.

Please see the developers.txt files in each code directory for more specific
notes, comments and to do lists.

To Do List:
-----------

TODO: write this document

TODO: write abstract eye tracker interface

TODO: write eyelink eye tracker interface
	  the initial version of this is written and basically working.
	  There could be a thread that handles at least the polling for samples
	  but perhaps could handle other elements as well.

TODO: write abstract digital I/O interface
	  there should be the basic read/write functions--modeled on existing
	  but for most work the best would be to setup a thread that reads/writes
	  when requested via messages
