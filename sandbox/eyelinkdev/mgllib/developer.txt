Notes for Developers
--------------------

MGLLIB specific notes and To Dos should be placed here.


**
Should all parameter checking, etc for 'Private' functions occur in their
non-private matlab wrappers? This keeps the code simpler to read and more
reliable (less matlab <-> C errors likely)?
**
mglCreateTexture contains a lot of generic texture code that could be used in
other texture functions (e.g. mglPrivateEyelinkCalibration) but would need to
be separated into a library. If there are enough instances like this, I think
it would make sense to break the mgl.h functions and these other accessory
functions into an mgllib.a (or mgllib.dylib if appropriate). I know this makes
linking slightly more complicated, but I think in the long run it would make
mgllib more rational.

Is GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE == GLubyte
