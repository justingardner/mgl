Although I didn't see a formal license with the file, the site did contain this friendly text:

MPEG Video File
An MPG is a popular video format (video inline player animation) standardized by the Moving Picture Experts Group. Movies in MPEG are compressed using MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 codec.

If you need any MPEG file to test your app, just choose resolution and size and download it for free.
