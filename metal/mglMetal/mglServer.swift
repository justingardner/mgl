// Protocol for communication with matlab.
// This defines a set of methods that can be used
// to accept connections, read, and write to matlab.
//
// It is declared as a protocol so that future
// versions of the code need simply conform to this
// protocol and can replace the underlying
// communication strucutre.
//
// This protocol assumes implementations use the
// RAII pattern, which means system Resources
// are Acquired during Initialization ie init(),
// and then released during deinitialization ie
// deinit {}.  For sockets this would include
// creating and binding a socket to some address.
