%    purpose: Flush all stashed and active mgl contexts.
%      usage: results = mglContextFlushAll()
%
%             This will flush all known mgl contexts, including the active
%             context in "global mgl", plus any contexts that were
%             previously stashed with mglContextStash.
%
%             Flushing in this way will not cause a state change as to
%             which contexts are active vs stashed.
%
%             % Open two separate mgl contexts, on separate displays.
%             mglOpen(0);
%             mglContextStash('windowed');
%             mglOpen(1);
%             mglContextStash('fullscreen');
%
%             % Flush all contexts, whether active or stashed.
%             mglContextFlushAll();
%
%             % Clean up all contexts, whether active or stashed.
%             mglContextCloseAll();
function results = mglContextFlushAll()

% Collect socketInfo for all known contexts, active and/or stashed.
% My (BSH) hope is to handle looping within the mglSocket* mex-functions
% that are called from mglFlush.  This works, but the implementation here
% is a bit fiddly, gathering up known socketInfo structs.
