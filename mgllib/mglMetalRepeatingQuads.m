%    purpose: Send one command that causes multiple frames of random quads.
%      usage: [ackTime, drawTimes, frameTimes] = mglMetalRepeatingQuads(nFrames, nQuads, randomSeed)
%     inputs: nFrames -- how long in frames the repeated quads should last
%             nQuads -- how many quads to draw per frame.
%             randomSeed -- integer seed for Metal to use when initializing
%                           the sequence of flickering frames.
%
%             This one command will cause a sequence of nFrames to be
%             drawn, each frame will have nQuads quads drawn in it.
%
%             Currently the quads are random and not able to be controlled
%             as they are with mglQuad.  The quads will have:
%               - vertex x- and y-coordinates chosen uniformly from -1 to 1
%               - RGB color values chosen uniformly from 0 to 1
%
%             This will return a single ackTime for when the command was
%             received to begin the sequence of frames.
%
%             It will also return an array of nFrames drawTimes,
%             indicating when drawing was completed during each frame, and
%             an array of nFrames frameTimes indicating when each frame was
%             completed.
%
% % Cycle through several frames of random quads.
