%    purpose: Send one command that causes multiple texture blts.
%      usage: [ackTime, drawTimes, frameTimes] = mglMetalRepeatingBlts(nFrames)
%     inputs: nFrames -- how long in frames the repeated blts should last
%
%             All of the textures that were previously created with
%             mglCreateTexture will be blt-ed in turn.  The repetitions
%             will continue to loop through all these textures in
%             descending order, until reaching nFrames blts.
%
%             Currently the blts are less flexible than with mglBltTexture.
%             The configuration is limited to:
%               - an unrotated square of length 2, centered at (0,0)
%               - "nearest" texture sampling (no interpolation)
%               - "repeat" texture addressing (wrapping)
%               - no phase shift in the texture coordinates
%
%             This will return a single ackTime for when the command was
%             received to begin the sequence of frames.
%
%             It will also return an array of nFrames drawTimes,
%             indicating when drawing was completed during each frame, and
%             an array of nFrames frameTimes indicating when each frame was
%             completed.
%
% % Cycle through several random, full-screen textures.
% mglOpen();
% for ii = 1:30
%     textures(ii) = mglCreateTexture(rand(mglGetParam('screenHeight'), mglGetParam('screenWidth'), 4));
% end
% [ackTime, drawTimes, frameTimes] = mglMetalRepeatingBlts(300);
%
% % Plot how long each frame took.
% frameStarts = frameTimes(1:end-1);
% frameDurations = frameTimes(2:end) - frameStarts;
% drawDurations = drawTimes(2:end) - frameStarts;
% plot(2:300, 1000 * drawDurations, 'b.', 2:300, 1000 * frameDurations, 'r.');
