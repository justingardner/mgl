You have been invited to take part in a study to learn more about visual perception. This study will be conducted by Professor Justin Gardner of the Department of Psychology and Stanford Neurosciences Institute at Stanford University, or by a designated member of his research staff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If you agree to be in this study, you may be asked to do some or all of the following: (1) Complete a questionnaire about your background (age, gender, education, etc); (2) View simple images and/or listen to sounds and to perform simple visual discrimination and/or auditory discrimination tasks.

										<p> 
                    The expected duration for this study is described on this job's listing on the Mechanical Turk website. There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research beyond those of everyday life. Although you will receive no direct benefits from the experiment, this research may help the investigator understand human visual perception better. 
										</p>

										<p>
The payment for this study is described on this job's listing on the Mechanical Turk website. If you withdraw before the end of the study, no payment will be given. Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained. We assign code numbers to each participant so that data is never directly linked to individual identity. To participate, you must be at least 18 years old and have normal vision or corrected-to-normal vision (e.g. eyeglasses or contacts). You may proceed at your own pace and take rest breaks as needed.  
										</p>

										<p>
Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without penalties other than the loss of approval on Mechanical Turk. For questionnaires or surveys, you have the right to skip or not answer any questions you prefer not to answer. 
										</p>

										<p>
If you have any concerns, complaints, or general questions about the research or your rights as a participant, please contact the Stanford Institutional Review Board (IRB) to speak to someone independent of the research team at (650)-723-2480 or toll free at 1-866-680-2906.
